Command line tool "Groot" that analyzes the popularity of an organization's GitHub repos.  Reports statistics for the following four dimensions:

* Top-N repos by number of stars.
* Top-N repos by number of forks.
* Top-N repos by number of Pull Requests (PRs).
* Top-N repos by contribution percentage (PRs/forks).

## Features
* Written in [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/)
* Supports threaded REST calls, threads are configurable at the command line
* Supports analyzing multiple github repos with single command line call
* Debug output for performance and REST call info
* Log4j logging
* Encapsulated in single class that can be reused in any JVM applicaiton

## Usage
```
usage: groovy Groot [options] [orgs]
Options:
 -d       debug output
 -help    print this message
 -n <n>   Top N repos (default 10)
 -t <t>   Maximum threads to use (default 10)
```

## Installing
1. Install Java 7 or later
1. [Install Groovy 2.4](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Installing+Groovy)
1. Download [Groovy.groot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebukoski/netflix-topn/master/Groot.groovy)
1. Run it!  NOTE: the first time run will be a bit slow as all dependencies are downloaded.
```
$ groovy Groot -help
```

## Limitations
* Org and repo properites (stars, forks, etc) are assumed to be present, will error out hard if they are missing
* Most exceptions are pushed all the way back to the stack
* Log4J output formatting could be improved
* Would be nice to create a [Unix-friendly Groovy script](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Running) that doesn't require Groovy on the command line

## Tests

JUnit tests are provided in the file [GroovyTest.groovy](https://github.com/ebukoski/netflix-topn/blob/master/GrootTest.groovy).  To run the tests:

```
$ groovy GrootTest
```

## Examples

##### 1) analyze the NASA repos and return Top 1 ranking using default thread settings
```
$ groovy Groot -n 1 nasa

##### 2) analyze the NASA repos and return Top 3 ranking using 15 threads
```
$ groovy Groot -n 3 -t 15 nasa
